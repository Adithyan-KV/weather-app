# Javascript weather app

A basic weather app made using vanilla javascript and the openweathermap
API. 

## Usage

__Ofcourse no one ever should ever use this, it's pretty shit. But for my 
own reference__,
Clone the repository. Register an account on openweathermap if you don't
already have one. Get an API key. Add a config file to the base
directory of the repository and put the API key inside it in the format
```
var config = {
	API_KEY: 'api_key_goes_here'
}
```
